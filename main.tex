\begin{abstract}

  Electrical control of the brain facilitates a variety of therapeutic
  and scientific goals, from treating sensory, motor, and cognitive
  defects to exploring the effects of disrupting or modifying the
  brain's behaviour in real time.  These methods are limited by the
  brain's immune reaction to foreign matter: over a period of months,
  glia encapsulate the electrodes, isolating them from neurons. Small
  electrodes ($<$ 10 $\mu$m) minimise encapsulation, and thus can both
  record single neurons for many months and precisely stimulate small
  groups of neurons.  However, such small electrodes are deliecate,
  and their high impedance requires stimulation voltages that exceed
  the water hydrolysis point.

  We have previously developed an electrode design in which groups of
  thin electrodes support each other during insertion and then splay
  in the brain. Here we describe the splaying properties of these
  electrode arrays.  We present preliminary results showing that these
  electrodes remain capable of recording individual spikes for a year
  after implantatiion.  We present preliminary evidence that the
  spatial scale of the splaying is sufficient to allow the steering of
  current between the electrodes, and demonstrate two consequences:
  current-steered control of the electrode array can produce neural
  responses while keeping stimulation voltages below safety limits,
  and permits some control over the shape of the response.

\section{Introduction}

Direct control of the brain---the ability to sense and modify its
dynamics in real time---is a longstanding goal in neuroscience,
engineering, and medicine. Sensing has been achieved on a variety of
spatial scales in humans and non-humans, using fMRI, electrode
headcaps, trans-cranial magnetic stimulation, optigenetics, and with
surgically implanted electrodes, both on the surface of the cortex and
implanted into deep brain areas. Patch clamping can record individual
neurons, but is at present infeasible for chronic implants in behaving
animals. Small extracellular electrodes can potentially still provide
high spatial and temporal resolution, recording individual neurons and
stimulating over regions on the scale of a single dendritic
tree. Increasing the channel count of these electrodes allows
recording signals from different locations simultaneously, as well as
greater control over stimulation. Increasing the size of the electrode
makes it more robust and more capable of safely injecting enough
current to modify neural dynamics, at the expense of spatial
resolution and chronic recording capability. We propose that a
multichannel electrode consisting of thin carbon fibres, combined with
appropriate current steering, can achieve fine spatial resolution,
biological compatibility, safe stimulation, and produce a variety of
different neural dynamics.

Much of the work in current steering in the brain is due to interest
in deep brain stimulation (DBS).  Despite the lack of understanding of
the precise mechanisms of DBS, it has been successfully used to treat
various movement disorders (especially those associated with
Parkinson's disease), epilepsy, Alzheimer's, chronic pain, cluster
headache, depression, OCD, addictive behaviours, anorexia, and others
\cite{Udupa2015dbs}.

DBS electrodes usually consist of single rods 1.2--1.6 mm in diameter
with 4--32 contacts. Large electrodes cause damage during surgery, and
over the course of weeks and months, glia gradually encapsulate
intruding electrodes, rendering them less effective over time. For
example, \cite{Butson2008steering} notes a 500-$\mu$m encapsulation
layer for the $\sim$ 1.3-mm electrodes common in DBS.  This
encapsulation results in ever-increasing stimulation thresholds,
rendering the electrodes unable to record as effectively
\cite{Barrese2016electrodestability,Biran2005gliosis,Polikov2005gliosis,Winslow2010gliosis}.

Even before glial encapsulation, large electrodes lack sufficient
spatial resolution to record or stimulate near the single-neuron
spatial scale, and instead can sense and modify only local field
potentials. At this spatial scale, most current-steering methods use
computational models of brain tissue to predict steering
configurations that preferentially target the intended area, or make
up for errors in electrode placement during surgery
\cite{Holloway2005stereotaxy}. One approach
\cite{Butson2008steering,Chaturvedi2012} builds a model of the tissue
of interest using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion
tensor imaging (DTI) \cite{Tuch2001conductivity,Alexander2007dti}.
This produces data with voxels of roughly 2 mm\textsuperscript{3}.
They then use finite element analysis to optimise current
steering.\marginpar{Lots more references might be added here, all of
  which have spatial resolution on this order and a variety of
  temporal resolutions; choose $\approx$3 or just cite a review?} The
accuracy of this and related approaches is appropriate given the size
of DBS electrodes; however, the techniques will not provide sufficient
accuracy to take advantage of the control available with small
electrodes.

A promising example of current steering outside the brain uses
64-channel electrode arrays, with electrode as closely packed as 30
$\mu$m, to stimulate macaque retina {\em in vitro}
\cite{Jepson2014steering_in_retina}. They stimulated the retina using
single electrodes or combinations of three electrodes with
charge-balanced pulses, and found that retinal response could be
predicted with a piecewise linear model. The connectivity of retinal
cells differs from that in most other brain regions, but we feel that
this experiment nonetheless hints at the potential of neuron-scale
current steering.

There has also been interest in\marginpar{Do we care? Remove this
  paragraph?} current steering outside the brain. For example,
\cite{king2006current_steeriing_optimisation} describes an algorithm
for clinician-assisted search for effective stimulation in
multielectrode arrays in the spinal cord.  The patent defines an
algorithm for hillclimbing search, controlled by a clinician.
\cite{parramon2011current_steering_optimisation} develops a
specialised hillclimbing search method.

Most DBS systems deliver some kind of stimulation continuously.
Recently, interest in using biological feedback to tune medical
devices has grown.  Due to the size of the electrodes, for feedback
control most systems rely on large-spatial-scale metrics such as local
field potentials (LFP) \cite{Priori2013adbs-lfp} and other macroscopic
measures of outcome such as surface electromyography\marginpar{Basu,
  ``Pathological tremor prediction using surface electromyogram and
  acceleration''} and accelerations
\cite{Afshar2012closedloop}\marginpar{Great review:
  \cite{Priori2015review}}. The addition of feedback from a second
electrode in a related brain region has been shown to be effective in
ameliorating Parkinsonian symptoms in monkeys
\cite{Rosin2011adbs}. Their use of tungsten microelectrodes allowed
their system to demonstrate the effectiveness of feedback that
responds to individual spikes rather than just LFPs.

Insertion damage, glial encapsulation over time, and poor spatial
scale of large electrodes are all mitigated by electrodes $<$ 10
$\mu$m, but these present two difficulties: they are too fragile to
insert, and during stimulation, their small surface area requires high
voltage in order to deliver sufficient current to induce response.

The hexadecode of \cite{Guitchounts2013electrode} overcomes the
structural fragility of thin electrodes by using multiple (in our
case, 16) shanks each of which is small enough to avoid adverse tissue
reactions.  They bundle together to support each other structurally
during implantation, and separate and splay in the brain, giving
randomly distributed sites for recording and stimulation. Here we
quantify that splay.

In a current-controlled stimulating electrode,\marginpar{Why
  current-controlled?}  the voltage required to induce neural activity
goes up as the impedance increases and charge injection capacity
decreases. Neural damage is likely to occur when voltage exceeds the
hydrolysis point for water (around 1.2 V). This is not a problem for
large DBS electrodes, whose surface area tends to be ample and which
are in any case encapsulated by glia, but it creates a problem for our
small electrodes (area per shank is around 250 $\mu\textrm{m}^3$):
their impedance is high and their charge delivery capacity is poor,
leading to high voltage requirements for stimulation.

We address the voltage problem in two ways. First, we confirm that
electroplating the electrodes in iridium oxide, as suggested by
\cite{Cogan2008electrodes}, leads to roughly a tenfold improvement in
both impedance and charge injection capacity.\marginpar{Confirm
  improvement in charge delivery. Yarden has numbers of gold
  $\rightarrow$ IrOx, but do we have carbon $\rightarrow$ IrOx
  anywhere?} Second, we introduce a novel current-steering technique,
and provide preliminary evidence that appropriate choice of
current-steering configuration can be used to reduce stimulation
voltage.

Due to their size, the multichannel, spatially distributed,
micron-scale arrays introduced in \cite{Guitchounts2013electrode}
allow long-term single-unit recordings, enabling new experiments
investigating how the brain changes on long timescales. Here we
provide preliminary evidence showing:
\begin{itemize}
\item How often the electrodes splay correctly in the brain, and the spatial scale of that splay.
\item That the electrodes can record activity in single units a year after surgery.
\item That the electrodes can be used to stimulate the brain.
\item That the spatial scale of splay is sufficient to allow effective current steering.
  \item That current steering can be used to reduce injected voltage, thus keeping neurons safe while still delivering clinically significant results.
\item That current-steered control of stimulation inputs allows
fine-grained control over small groups of neurons, potentially
permitting a wide variety of optimisations, such as controlling the
brain to some set of desired responses.
\end{itemize}

We were able to build only a limited supply of the electrodes, and
thus provide chronic stimulation data from a very small number of
birds. This is a serious limitation of the study, and thus our results
should be regarded as preliminary. However, we believe that even as
they stand they will nonetheless be of interest to the community,
suggesting capabilities that have not heretofore been available.




\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Electrode construction}

Electrode arrays were constructed as described in
\cite{Guitchounts2013electrode}.  The charge transfer capacity of one
of the electrode arrays used for stimulating in Area X was enhanced by
electrodeposited iridium oxide.  \cite{Cogan2008electrodes} describes
the electrochemistry of charge transfer.

\subsubsection{Charge injection}

In order to increase the charge injection capacity of our electrodes,
electroplate them with iridium oxide.  This effects an
improvement of roughly an order of magnitude: impedances went from
around 2 M$\Omega$ to 200 k$\Omega$, and for a given current, the
required voltage was much lower.\marginpar{FIXME} We also experimented
with PEDOT, which has excellent charge-injection properties, but we
found it to have durability issues.\marginpar{All I know about this is
  hearsay.}  See \cite{Cogan2008electrodes} for a review of electrode
physics.
\subsection{Bird surgery description}

\subsubsection{Animals and Perfusions}

At the end of the experiment, the birds were given an overdose of
pentobarbital and perfused with 0.1M phosphate buffer followed by 4\%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PB.  Brain with skull were removed. The
electrodes were secured on the skull and brain. 2--4 holes were made
on the skull to facilitate the solutions to get in. Following an
overnight postfix in 4\% paraformaldehyde, brain with skull was
treated overnight in 15\% and 30\% sucrose\marginpar{Which?} in 0.1M PB at 4$^\circ$C.
Brain slices with the electrodes were collected. The tissue samples
were sectioned towarding to the tips of the implanted elctrodes at
50--100$\mu$m by a cryostat (CM 3050 S, Leica). The tissue samples
were stored in $-20^\circ$C until immunohistochemistry was processed.

\subsubsection{Fluorescent Immunohistochemistry of NeuN, MBP and DAPI}

Sections of the brain were used for immunohistochemical staining of
Neun and DAPI. Non protein binding was blocked with 5\% normal donkey
serum. The primary antibody against neuronal nuclei was a mouse
anti-NeuN antibody (1:500, MAB377, A60, Chemicon) and the primary
antibody against myelin was a rabbit Anti-Myelin Basic Protein / MBP
Antibody (1:500, LS-C312288, LifeSpan BioSciences, Inc). Following
primary antibodies incubation for overnight at 4$^\circ$C, Alexa
Fluor® 488 AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (1:500, 715-545-150,
Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and Rhodamine (TRITC) AffiniPure
Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:500,711-025-152, Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories) added. The sections were coated with
mounting medium containing 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI,
VECTASHIELD).  The sections of brain were visualized and the images
were captured using a FV10i confocal microscopy(Olympus) and Olympus
FV10i software.

\subsubsection{Surgery information}

All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Boston University (protocol number 14-029). Zebra finches
\marginpar{Jun?} (n = ?; ?for acute experiments, ? for chronic HVC and Area X
recordings and ? for histology) ($>$120 days post-hatch) were
anesthetized with 4.0\% isoflurane and maintained at 1--2\% isoflurane
during the aseptic surgical procedure. The analgesic Meloxicam
(4mg/kg) was injected intramuscularly into the breast at the start of
the procedure and the animal was placed into a stereotaxic
instrument. Feathers were removed from the scalp and a Betadyne
solution applied. Bupivicane (4mg/kg) was then injected subcutaneously
into the scalp before an incision was made along the AP axis.

The same surgical procedure was followed for the acute and chronic
recording in Area X and HVC \cite{Guitchounts2013electrode}. The skull
over area X was localized using stereotactic coordinates (20° head
angle; 5.8 mm AP, 1.5 mm ML, 2.8 mm DV) and the skull over HVC was
localized using stereotactic coordinates (30° head angle; 0.7 mm AP,
2.3 mm ML, 0.4-0.7 mm DV), and the the outer bone leaflet removed at
the location of area X and HVC with a dental drill. The lower bone
leaflet was carefully removed with an opthalamic scalpel, similar to
implant procedures for recording with microdrives
\cite{Long2010synfire}, exposing a hole of $\sim 150 \mu$m diameter. A
minimal durotomy was performed using a dura pick (typical durotomy was
less than 50 microns.). A 16-channel carbon-fibre array
\cite{Guitchounts2013electrode} was mounted on a digital manipulator
attached to the stereotax and slowly lowered through the
durotomy. During insertion into the brain, the carbon fibres would
occasionally begin to visibly splay. After lowering the array to the
appropriate depth, the position in the song nucleus HVC was verified
using antidromic stimulation from another 16-channel array implanted
in downstream Area X
\cite{Hahnloser2002sparse,Guitchounts2013electrode}.  After verifying
the position of the array, the craniotomy was covered with the
silicone elastomer Kwik-Sil (World Precision Instruments), and the
array was glued into place using light-bonded acrylic (Flow-It ALC,
Pentron) along the entire length of the electrode shank, such that no
portion of the carbon fibre bundle was left exposed or loose. A $\sim
150\mu$m hole was made on the skull of cerebellum and both arrays’
grounding wires were secured in cerebellum using light-bonded acrylic.

\subsection{Splay histology}

Electrode bundles were implanted into birds, all to a depth of roughly
3 mm.  Most of these were ``dummy'' uncoated and blunt-cut rather than
fire-sharpened as in \cite{Guitchounts2013electrode}, with 10--16
channels (fibres).  The birds were killed, and their brains sectioned
roughly perpendicularly to the electrodes, with a slice thickness of
50 $\mu$m.\marginpar{Jun \& Sanne: what slice thickness?}

The following criteria were used to exclude observations:\marginpar{Sanne: check exclusion criteria.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Individual shafts were excluded if they were lying flat on the surface of the tissue (visible as side-on cylinders).
\item Bundles were excluded if they were implanted in fibres of passage.
\end{itemize}


Clustering was done by hand.  The set of distances between electrodes
was computed by measuring the distance between each electrode and its
nearest neighbour.\marginpar{I'm about a day from finishing software
  to do all-to-all comparison.  For the draft (and possibly first
  submission, if time is tight) this suffices.}  Bundles were
clustered as follows:
\begin{description}
\item[Splayed:] All electrodes were more than 10 $\mu$m from each other, or at most one pair was closer.\marginpar{Why 10 $\mu$m?}
\item[Partial:] Some \marginpar{How many?} electrodes were more than 10 $\mu$m from each other.
\item[Clumped:] All electrodes were within 10 $\mu$m of each other.  \marginpar{All-to-all, or nearest-neighbour?}
\end{description}
\par\noindent Examples of these three categories are shown in \fig{fig:splay_montage}.

\begin{figure}
  % montage -geometry 1024x1024 splay_full.jpeg splay_partial.jpeg splay_no.jpeg splay_montage.eps
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{splay_montage}
  \caption{Splay types, left to right: examples of full splay, partial
    splay, and clumped.  In all images, black circles are electrode
    shafts; in many cases the slicing plane is not quite orthogonal to
    the electrodes, yielding oblong images.  In the bright-field image
    on the right, three of the electrode slices were pulled out of the
    tissue during slicing, and appear to lie flat on the slide.  Since
    their original locations cannot be determined, we have ignored
    them.}
  \label{fig:splay_montage}
\end{figure}

\marginpar{Would it make sense to automatically cluster the splay data?  Or to change the criteria?  I can think of some changes\dots}


\subsection{Recording}

For electrophysiology (recording and stimulation), birds were anesthatised with 1.5\% isoflurane, 98.5\% oxygen, at 0.5 liters/minute.

Recording of spontaneous activity in Area X was with an Intan RHD2000 amplifier at 20 kHz, with a high-pass filter at 200 Hz.  Recordings were broken down into data files 1 minute long.  Any data file with any sample whose absolute value was $>500\mu$V was assumed to have excessive recording noise, and was discarded.

\subsection{Stimulation: Zebra finch antidromic HVC $\leftarrow$ X}

Electrical stimulation saturates the brain, including at the site of
the recording electrode, for some time post-stimulation. Artifacts were visible in the recording traces for 1--3 ms post-stimulus.  Responses to
stimulation can be detected outside of that saturation window.  A
common technique for locating HVC in the zebra finch involves
implanting a stimulating electrode in Area X and looking for a an
antidromic response, which is visible in HVC and not in the
surrounding tissue \cite{Swadlow1998antidromic,Hahnloser2002sparse}.
Since the two brain areas are separated by about 5 mm, this response
occurs 3--8 ms after stimulation\marginpar{Tim: citation for 3--8
  ms?}, which gives the recording amplifier time to settle before
measuring the response.\marginpar{But why antidromic?}

For discussion of the stimulation paradigm, we will use the following definitions:

\begin{description}
\item[Channel:] Our electrodes have 16 channels, each of which is an individual carbon fibre connected to its own amplifier.
\item[Pulse:] A biphasic charge-balanced square wave of current.  Each phase is 200 $\mu s$ long, and there is no interpulse interval.
\item[Current steering:] Delivering pulses, usually of opposite signs, to two or more electrodes in order to control the geometry of current flow through the tissue.
\item[Current-steering configuration (CSC):] The configuration defining which channels receive the positive half of their biphasic pulse first, or vice versa.
\item[Pulse train:] A sequence of $n$ (usually 10) identical current-steered stimuli delivered to all active channels, usually at 25 Hz.  This is slow enough that pulses do not interfere with each other, and is used to measure the reliability of the response.
\item[Threshold scan:] A series of pulse trains, each of which has the same CSC but a different current, designed to find the minimum current for this CSC that will induce an antidromic response in HVC.  The algorithm is described below.
\item[Voltage scan:] The Plexon hardware can deliver a current-controlled pulse to each of 16 channels independently, but only allows monitoring of the voltage delivered on one channel at a time. A voltage scan involves sending the same pulse train once per active electrode, monitoring a different one each time.
\end{description}

The stimulation and recording electrodes use separate electrical
returns, consisting of silver wire in contact with the
skull.  Some CSCs balance current delivery between the electrodes,
whereas others do not, and in the latter case excess current flows
through the common return.

We used a Plexon stimulator to control stimulation in Area X, and
recorded from HVC using a Tucker-Davis Technologies (TDT) RZ5
amplifier\marginpar{And/or an Intan, depending on which recording to
  show in \fig{fig:clear_hvc_response}}.  The Plexon self-monitoring
channels were recorded on a National Instruments (NI) PCI-6251 data
acquisition card using the session-based interface of Matlab (various
versions from 2014a through 2015b) on Windows 8.1.

Custom MATLAB software controls the experiment, initiating spike train
delivery and response monitoring.  The Plexon's self-monitoring
channels are recorded by the NI card, and the neural response in HVC
is recorded by the TDT.  In order to guarantee precise temporal
alignment between stimulus delivery and response measurement, all
hardware is triggered by a TTL pulse from the NI card when it begins
its acquisition cycle.  The Plexon begins stimulating upon receipt of
that TTL pulse, and the TDT begins recording at 24.414 kHz (the
device's native frequency) on the same signal.  Whenever the Plexon is
actively delivering current (i.e. during each pulse within the train)
it sends out its own TTL pulse: this signal is recorded by the TDT
along with the HVC electrode voltages.  Thus the data alignment
precision is controlled by the sampling rate of the TDT (41 $\mu$s).

Programming the stimulator for one pulse train and running it (10 pulses at 25 Hz) requires a little over 2 seconds. A threshold scan requires, on average, around 15 pulse trains, and so generally takes a bit more than 30 seconds. Likewise, a voltage scan requires delivering one pulse train per active electrode, for a total of about 30 seconds.

\subsubsection{Response detection}
\label{sec:responsedetection}

HVC projects into Area X (and into RA, which we do not discuss here).
When Area X is stimulated, an antidromic response may be observed both
in HVC\textsubscript{X} projection neurons and in HVC interneurons.
The antidromic response occurs roughly 3--8 ms after the stimulation
pulse, and is highly stereotyped: \cite{Fee2004mechanisms} reports
that the variability in the timing of the antidromic response in
HVC\textsubscript{X} projection neurons is under 50 $\mu$s, while that
of HVC intraneurons is above 500 $\mu$s.

\fig{fig:clear_hvc_response} shows an example of a pronounced HVC
response to stimulation in Area X.  We detected this response in two different ways, one during experiment runtime and one in postprocessing analysis:

During runtime (threshold and voltage scans), we measured the
cross-correlation between the recorded response for each pulse in a
train and each other with a maximum lag of 100 $\mu$s, which provides
a robust way of separating neural response from noise.  Because the
HVC amplifier's (Intan's or TDT's) response to the transient
stimulation pulse in Area X can persist into the time of interest
(3--8 ms), each response is first de-trended using a
maximum-likelihood fit over the region 2--25 ms using an eigth order
Fourier Series, which removes post-stimulation decay while leaving
spike-sized signals intact.\marginpar{Filtering would probably work
  better with the TDT than with the Intan\dots} We found this strongly
biased smoothing technique more cleanly removes the large stimulation
artifact than the conventional approach of bandpass-filtering the
signal. The cross-correlation threshold above which a response is
identified is chosen by visual inspection.

A further, independent voltage-threshold analysys was performed on the
data offline.  For each train of $n$ pulses, we labeled peaks greater
than 5 standard deviations from the RMS noise of a nearby (within 20
ms) non-stimulated recording on the same electrode.  For each of the
$n$ stimuli in the pulse train, all peaks' delays post-stimulus were
compared to those from the other $n-1$ responses, and any peak whose
delay was within 100 $\mu$s of another peak was considered a response
to the stimulus.  The probability of a response at this current was
then the maximum number of aligned peaks divided by the number $n$ of
pulses in the train.  Given the set of points
Pr(response$\,\,|\,\,$maximum electrode voltage), we then fit a
sigmoid $0.5 + 0.5 \tanh(\lambda(x-\mu))$ to this curve, and take the
midpoint $\mu$ as the voltage required to induce a response with
probability 50\%.

As the bird ages, the implant bonding site is slowly pushed away
from\marginpar{Details or citation?  Possibly
  \cite{Barrese2016electrodestability}, although they don't really
  discuss this so much.} the skull.  For shallow installations such as
HVC (depth $\approx 200\mu m$, the quality of the HVC recordings
diminishes as electrodes are forced out of contact with the brain.
This makes it more and more difficult over time to measure the
antidromic response.  The above cross-correlation technique for
response detection is more sensitive than the method typically used
during acute or short-term response measurements, in which a
pronounced spike is often clearly visible and is identified by eye on
an oscilloscope.  We are confident that we are measuring an antidromic
response because it is on the correct timescale both in delay
post-stimulus and in consistency, appears near the expected
stimulation threshold, and has the expected shape.\marginpar{Cite
  papers giving timing and stimulation threshold.}

\subsubsection{Threshold scan}

What stimulation parameters are required in order to reliably elicit
an antidromic response to stimulation in Area X?  How can this
threshold be found quickly, while minimising the risk of exceeding
safe stimulation voltages?  How can this process be made robust to
noise?\marginpar{How can we establish how much robustness to noise is
  required?}


After choosing a CSC, we begin stimulating at a current that is
known to be below threshold.  While no response is seen, the current
is increased gradually by a small factor ($\alpha \approx 1.1$) until
either a response is detected or the voltage or current limit is
exceeded.  In the latter case, a lack of response is reported, and we
move on to the next CSC.  If a response is found, then the step size
is decreased towards unity ($\alpha \leftarrow \alpha^{2/3}$) and we reduce the
current until the response disappears.  This process is repeated until
the step size drops below a limit ($\alpha < 1.02$), and the threshold
is taken as the last parameter set that induced a response.

While a larger step size would result in a faster search, and a binary
search would be easier to describe, this ad-hoc approach samples near
the current of interest while making it unlikely that we will
stimulate with a current that significantly exceeds the minimum
required for a response, and thus minimises the possibility of
injuring the bird.

\subsubsection{Voltage scan}

Once the minimum current required in order to achieve a response is
identified, we perform a voltage scan at that current, in order to
measure the peak voltage delivered to each electrode.

After exclusion, 22 arrays, implanted into 13 different birds, each
yielded at least 3 measurable electrodes.  See

for visualisations thereof.\marginpar{Perhaps take out the table and

of single electrodes, and slightly more in clumped electrode groups.
Visual inspection can give some indication of the damage done to the
brain and the likelihood of achieving good electrical contact with
neurons, but we are more interested in the ability to interact with
the brain (see Section~\ref{sec:results:recording}).

\subsection{Chronic recording}
\label{sec:results:recording}

\subsubsection{Impedances}

\subsubsection{HVC}

Long-term recording in HVC is difficult due to skull regrowth
interfering with electrodes implanted only a few hundred microns from
the surface: after 10 months, we had difficulty picking up antidromic
response in our two remaining birds, and while the techniques
described in Sec.~\ref{sec:responsedetection} were more sensitive and
robust than detection by eye, eventually the signal-to-noise ratio
became too low for them as well.

\subsubsection{Area X}

More telling of the potential of these electrodes is the recording of
spontaneous activity in Area X, which was still easily seen in several
channels after a year.\marginpar{I don't have recording-only data from
  early on.}  \fig{fig:XSpikeRecording} shows recordings a year after implantation for the most stable electrodes of the 16.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Stimulation}

\subsubsection{Minimising stimulation voltage}

Some CSCs were better at triggering an antidromic response than
others.  From the $2^{11}$ possible CSCs we chose 32 (30 randomly, and
the two that treated all electrodes identically).  For each CSC, we
performed a threshold scan to find the minimum current needed to
trigger a response.  When this current was found, we performed a
voltage scan to find the maximum potential on any electrode.  We
tested each CSC five times on an anesthetised bird.  Results are shown
in \fig{fig:VoltageVsCSC}.  The best CSCs resulted in a maximum
voltage of around 1 V, while the worst were over 2.5 V.  Perhaps
surprisingly, the CSCs that sent identical pulses to all 11 electrodes
were among the worst performers, with our simple search revealing CSCs
that kept voltages far lower.

The maximum-likelihood fits to the voltage sweep data (green errorbars
in \fig{fig:VoltageVsCSC}) consistently yield slighly higher threshold
voltages than those measured using the search.  This is because
whereas the maximum-likelihood fit computes the voltage required in
order to obtain a response with 50\% probability, the threshold
search, which guided data acquisition in realtime, looks for any
significant correlation between the responses in each spike train,
which is detectable well before the stimulation achieves a 50\%
response rate.

\noprint{FIXME: The following caveat doesn't apply to
  lw95rhp-2015-12-04: Each threshold scan terminated when a
  stimulation voltage over 3 V was detected, so for some datasets
  (e.g. lw95rhp-2015-12-09) we were unable to acquire all five
  measurements for some CSCs, and thus they are worse than the figure
  shows.}

    post-surgery.  The X axis lists the configuration (each of the 11
    active electrodes delivers a positive-first ``0'' or

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Steering}

\cite{Jepson2014steering_in_retina} showed good capacity to control
stimulation by steering current between electrodes in monkey retina,
allowing targeting of neurons on a smaller scale than the electrode
spacing.  The demonstration of fine control is compelling, but whether
or not the locally linear predictive response model that they found
effective in retina would be extensible to regions with greater
lateral connectivity is unknown.

\cite{Histed2009stimulation} showed that injecting current into tissue
causes neurons whose axons are very close to the stimulation site to
fire, rather than neurons whose bodies are at greater distances.  As a
result, the set of neurons that respond to a stimulation pulse is
highly sensitive to electrode location, but has spatial extent similar
to that of the neuron's dendritic tree.  Furthermore, they showed that
neurons stimulated in this manner seldom stimulate downstream neurons
synaptically.

Splaying electrode arrays with learning stimulation software may be
able to exploit these properties.  First consider each of the $n$
electrodes in our array separately.  $n$ sites stimulated at a given
current gives $n$ different random sets of $k_n$ neurons that will
fire, and increasing the current changes the size of $k$.  There may
exist multiple downstream neurons $y$ such that directly-stimulatable
neurons from several of our $n$ sets synapse onto $y$.  This creates a
search problem: how to stimulate the $n$ sets in a way that reliably
stimulates $y$ enough to cause it to spike?  This requires search over
current delivered to each group in $n$ in order to control which
neurons are recruited, and timing of stimulation delivery to each
group in $n$, so that the downstream neuron is reliably triggered.
Different values of current and timing delivered into the $n$ groups
may trigger different downstream neurons, so one possible search problem is
finding as many different downstream neurons as possible.

Furthermore, it seems likely that directly-stimulatable neurons may
synapse onto others that are directly-stimulatable, once or $r$ times
removed.  This suggests a further dynamic for the timing search, in
which different timings for stimulating the $n$ sets may trigger
different firing sequences (\cite{Jepson2014steering_in_retina}
proposes a related mechanism in the context of current steering in
retina).  This enlarges the space of inducible dynamics considerably,
and suggests the possibility of controlling Hebbian learning.

Whereas Histed used single electrodes, we use miltichannel arrays.
Rather than a 16-channel array providing $n=16$ groups of neurons,
different current-steering configurations may lead to a much higher
value of $n$.  For such an electrode there are $2^{16}$
current-steering configurations even without manipulating current
pulse magnitude or timing, and with those additions the search space
is approximately infinite.

\subsection{Ongoing Learning}

The best clinical outcomes require about 20 hours\marginpar{Now where
  did I read this\dots?} of tuning time, involving multiple patient
visits to a clinic.

\subsection{Power}

Another limitation of DBS systems is power use: even with on-demand
therapy, the currents required in order to achieve good clinical
outcome drain power fast.  Small electrodes that drastically reduce
scarring allow stimulation currents several orders of magnitude lower
than state-of-the-art systems, and even if current steering does not
allow realtime therapy optimisation, it appears to allow further
optimisation of power usage.
